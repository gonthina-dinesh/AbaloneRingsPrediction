# Abalone Rings Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the number of rings in abalones, which serves as an indicator of their age. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's **Playground Series S4E4** competition. The objective is to build an accurate regression model that generalizes well across different abalone samples by leveraging key machine learning techniques.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Handling & Visualization
- Used **Pandas** for data exploration, cleaning, and visualization.
- Identified patterns and relationships between features to aid model development.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Imputation:** Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques to ensure data completeness.
- **Scaling & Encoding:** Applied feature scaling and encoding methods to standardize the dataset for machine learning models.

### 3. Model Development & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Selected **Random Forest Regressor** as the baseline model for initial performance assessment.
- Implemented **Gradient Boosting techniques** (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) to enhance accuracy.
- Performed **hyperparameter tuning** using Grid Search and Random Search to optimize model performance.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Developed new features to improve model interpretability and predictive accuracy.
- Conducted feature selection to retain only the most relevant features for better model generalization.

### 5. Final Submission
- Evaluated the final model using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R² Score).
- Submitted the model’s predictions to Kaggle for performance assessment.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)
- **Feature Engineering & Hyperparameter Tuning**
