AbaloneRingsPrediction

This project involves predicting the number of rings in abalones, using a dataset sourced from Kaggle's Playground Series S4E4 competition. The goal is to build an accurate regression model that can generalize well across different abalone samples, leveraging key machine learning techniques.
Project Overview

    Data Handling & Visualization: Used Python's Pandas library for data exploration and visualization to understand patterns and identify key features in the abalone dataset.
    Preprocessing:
        Imputation: Handled missing values with imputation techniques to ensure dataset completeness.
        Scaling & Encoding: Applied feature scaling and encoding to prepare the data for machine learning models.
    Modeling & Hyperparameter Tuning:
        Selected initial model candidates and tuned hyperparameters, starting with Random Forests for robust baseline performance.
        Enhanced model accuracy by implementing Gradient Boosting techniques.
    Feature Engineering: Developed new features to improve model interpretability and accuracy.
    Final Submission: Submitted the tuned modelâ€™s predictions to Kaggle to assess its performance.

This project showcases end-to-end model development, from data preprocessing to hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to machine learning regression tasks.
